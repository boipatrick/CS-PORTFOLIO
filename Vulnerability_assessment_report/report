VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

##
System Description

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

##
Scope

The purpose of this vulnerability assessment is to evaluate the existing access controls of the system. The assessment will span a timeframe of three months, specifically from June 2023 to August 2023. To ensure a comprehensive risk analysis of the information system, I will follow the guidelines outlined in NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1.

##
purpose

The database server serves as a centralized computer system responsible for storing and managing vast volumes of data. It functions as a repository for customer, campaign, and analytic data, enabling subsequent analysis to track performance and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. Due to its pivotal role in marketing operations, it is imperative to prioritize the security of this system.

##
**Approach**

The assessment of risks took into account the data storage and management procedures implemented by the business. By evaluating the likelihood of a security incident based on the open access permissions of the information system, potential threat sources and events were identified. The severity of these potential incidents was carefully assessed in relation to their impact on the organization's day-to-day operational requirements.

##
Remediation Strategy

Implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users access the database server. This includes using strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Encryption of data in motion using TLS instead of SSL. IP allow-listing to corporate offices to prevent random users from the internet from connecting to the database.
